## About Me
My name is Quyum Kehinde, and I'm a self-taught and highly self-motivated web developer from Nigeria.<br><br>
I love building web based software solutions that help improve lives, and make the world a better place for everyone.

When I'm not busy writing/maintaining a project, you'll find me sharing and absorbing tech content on Twitter.<br><br>
